This project is a reaction-based game where the player must press a button at the right moment to win. The circuit uses LEDs, a button, a buzzer, a potentiometer, and an LED matrix (MAX7219) to create an engaging and interactive game.
How It Works:
1.	LEDs light up in sequence (one after another at a speed controlled by the potentiometer).
2.	The player must press the button when the green LED is ON to win.
3.	If the button is pressed at the correct moment:
o	A win sound plays.
o	The score increases.
o	After five correct presses, a heart symbol appears on the LED matrix.
4.	If the button is pressed at the wrong time:
o	A fail sound plays.
o	The game resets and starts over.
5.	The potentiometer adjusts the speed of the LED sequence, making the game more challenging or easier.
